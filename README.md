# Time dynamics of systemic risk


This work investigates the dynamics of systemic risk in a banking network using the Undistressed-Exposed-Distressed-Recovered (UEDR) model. We focus on two critical times, denoted as $t_1$ and $t_2$, which play a fundamental role in understanding the behavior of the distressed compartment (representing the number of distressed banks) over time. The time $t_1$ represents the first instance of a decrease in the quantity of distressed banks, indicating the containment of systemic risk. On the other hand, the time $t_2$ marks the onset when the number of undistressed banks falls below a specified threshold, signifying the restoration of financial stability.   We examine these time dependencies by considering the initial conditions of the UEDR model and assess their characteristics using partial differential equations. We establish the continuity, smoothness, and uniqueness of solutions for $t_1$ and $t_2$, along with their corresponding boundary conditions. Furthermore, we provide explicit representation formulas for $t_1$ and $t_2$, allowing for precise estimation when the initial population compartments are large.
